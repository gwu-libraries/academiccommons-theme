# academiccommons-theme
Theme files for GWLAI's Academic Commons website.  

At the moment, the theme is currently called `lai` on the understanding that it would apply to all LAI sites as the base of the decoupled/headless theme.  Since at the moment I'm making changes only applicable to Academic Commons (e.g. the logo), I'm going to refer to this repo as academiccommons-theme and deal with LAI-wide theming when we come to the decoupled/headless bridge.
